# CiviPoints
An extension for CiviCRM. Allows points to be allocated to contacts.

### Installation
Install in the usual ways, either from the CiviCRM extensions repository or
by downloading directly from GitHub. If you download a snapshot you may need
to rename the extension's directory to the extension's key
(`uk.org.futurefirst.networks.civipoints`). If you intend to use CiviPoints with
CiviRules, install CiviRules first.

Create your points types in the 'Points Type' option group. It is suggested
that you keep the 'Value', or points type ID, numeric.

### Features
* Assign points to your contacts to track engagement with your campaigns
* Point-in-time history- see the points allocation as at a particular date
* Set expiry dates- optionally reset at the start of a year, a new school term,
or any other date you choose
* Edit and delete points given in error
* Report template and custom search- track your most engaged contacts by
creating league tables and smart groups
* Create multiple points types to track multiple programmes
* CiviRules integration: As an action, to *grant points automatically* in
response to some trigger. As a condition, so some action can be taken in
response to some trigger *if the contact has the right number of points*.
